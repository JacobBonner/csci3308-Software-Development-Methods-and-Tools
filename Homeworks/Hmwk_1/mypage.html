            <h1>Bonner, Jacob</h1>
            <p>I was born in a town called Squamish in British Columbia, Canada. I have been a musician since 6th grade, and at CU Boulder I play the trumpet in the Golden 
                Buffalo Marching Band. My older brother and I are three years apart, yet we share the same birthday. I am studying 
                computer science because I find it very interesting, and I hope to learn many skills that will prove beneficial as I move forward in life.
